## üìå Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women globally. Early and accurate diagnosis plays a critical role in effective treatment. Traditional mammography methods suffer from several limitations such as low contrast, noise, overlapping tissues, and manual interpretation errors. Our solution presents a dual-model approach using deep learning to overcome these limitations.

---

## üí° Motivation

Manual screening is prone to false negatives and false positives. With the availability of large annotated datasets and GPU-accelerated deep learning tools, it's now feasible to automate this process, reduce radiologist workload, and improve early detection rates.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Despite advances in CAD tools and CNN models, most existing systems:

* Lack robust preprocessing.
* Focus only on classification without lesion localization.
* Do not consider important metrics like MCC for imbalanced datasets.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

* Detect benign and malignant tumors using YOLOv8.
* Accurately segment lesions using Mask R-CNN.
* Employ preprocessing methods to enhance image quality.
* Train on annotated datasets in YOLO and COCO formats.
* Evaluate using clinical metrics like FPR, FNR, MCC, etc.
